## About Repository
<!--Wirte one paragraph of project description -->  
&nbsp;The project compared the performance of each of the **DQN** , **DDQN**, and **Dueling DQN**  methods in the Cartpole Reinforcement Learning environment.

## Overview
<!-- Write Overview about this project -->
&nbsp; **Cartpole** is a basic example of reinforcement learning. The goal is to move the cart and hold it for a long time without dropping the stick that is on the cart. In the Cartpole reinforcement learning environment, agents acquire know-how through trial and error.

&nbsp; The project was trained in Cartpole Reinforcement Learning environment with **DQN** (Deep-Q-Network), **DDQN** (Double Deep-Q-Network), and **Dueling DQN** (Duel Deep-Q-Network) methods, and then the performance was compared.
